For Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

I create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1.-Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.-Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.-Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.-Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.-From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'CodeBook.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the tidy.txt.

- 'tidy.txt': tidy data for training and test set.

- 'run_analisys.R': Code in R for tidy datasets

- 'leer.R': function for read file in *.txt used in run_analysis.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.


Notes: 
======
- Each variable in tidy.txt is the average for activity and subjects of mean and standard desviation of each variable in training and test data.
